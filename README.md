## Description
Using Express.js, Sequelize, Node.js, and MySQL; I created the backend of an e-commerce company's website. The goal for this project was to learn how to put all of those pieces together to create an API that a company can use to keep track of their inventory. This project used starter code provided by the MSU Coding BootCamp.
