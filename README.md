## Description
Using Express.js, Sequelize, Node.js, and MySQL; I created the backend of an e-commerce company's website. The goal for this project was to learn how to put all of those pieces together to create an API that a company can use to keep track of their inventory. This project used starter code provided by the MSU Coding BootCamp.

Open MySQL in powershell to run the schema for the database. Then run the command 'npm run seed' to seed the database. You can then open insomnia to run through looking at, adding, and subtracting different parts of the data!
